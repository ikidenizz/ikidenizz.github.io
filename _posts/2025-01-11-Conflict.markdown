## **On Conflict, Violence, and the Cost of Hatred**

It is disheartening to see how certain individuals or groups underestimate the intelligence of the public with misleading narratives. Let us address some facts clearly: Hizballah, a group widely recognized for its acts of terrorism and violence, initiated a conflict with Israel by launching rockets and missiles.

In doing so, they severely miscalculated their capacity to achieve their objectives. The result was devastating for their leadership and forces, including their leader, Hassan Nasrallah, whose actions only escalated suffering but brought no meaningful progress for the people they claim to represent.

The broader question we should be asking is this: What kind of ideology fosters such deep-rooted animosity that it drives individuals to prioritize perpetual conflict over the well-being and future of their own communities? Why is there such persistence in sacrificing the lives and futures of their children for a vision of jihad that repeatedly ends in loss and devastation, rather than pursuing paths that could uplift and empower their people?

It is time to reflect honestly on the self-destructive cycles perpetuated by these actions and the severe toll they take on all generations involved.
