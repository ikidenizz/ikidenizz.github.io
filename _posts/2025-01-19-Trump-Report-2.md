<div class="frame">
  <p>Trump's latest actions appear to reflect a troubling trend of exploiting U.S. power against economically weaker nations, raising questions about the motivations behind such decisions. This approach not only exacerbates global tensions but also risks being driven by personal insecurities rather than strategic foresight. Constructive leadership requires maturity and a focus on unity, not divisiveness.</p>
