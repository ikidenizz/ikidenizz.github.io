**Retaliation Based on Population Ratios: Justice or Injustice?**

The perception that when one Jewish terrorist is killed, 100 Muslim terrorists must be killed in retaliation, often justified by population ratios (20 million Jews compared to 2 billion Muslims), is both unjust and morally unacceptable. First and foremost, the principle that every individual is innocent until proven guilty (presumption of innocence) is a universal legal standard. Even in the fight against terrorism, legal processes and fair trials must be upheld. Killing individuals without proving they are terrorists, without trials or concrete evidence, especially targeting women and children, violates human rights and international law. For instance, the Geneva Conventions explicitly emphasize the protection of civilians. Moreover, such a logic of retaliation serves only to legitimize violence and deepen conflicts, rather than achieving justice. True justice can only be achieved by adhering to universal values and equally protecting the right to life of every individual.
