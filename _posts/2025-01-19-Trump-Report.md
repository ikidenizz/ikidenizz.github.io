## **Trump's Foreign Policy and Its Impact**

### **Introduction**

Donald Trump's foreign policy was characterized by unpredictability, isolationism, and confrontation, leaving lasting impacts on the U.S. and the world.

### **Conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan**
Despite his anti-war rhetoric, Trump failed to end the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. Instead, he escalated tensions with Iran and Syria. These decisions raised concerns about the direction of U.S. foreign policy.

### **Withdrawal from International Agreements**
Trump's decisions to withdraw from international agreements and alienate allies raised concerns about the direction of U.S. foreign policy. These actions weakened the U.S.'s international standing.

### **The Arms Lobby and Foreign Policy**
The influence of the arms lobby was evident during Trump's presidency, with $1.9 trillion in arms sales approved and significant donations received during the 2020 elections. This highlighted the sway of special interests on U.S. foreign policy decisions, sparking debates on the role of lobbying in shaping international relations.

### **The Cost of Occupation Policies in Iraq and Afghanistan**
The cost of the occupation policies in Iraq and Afghanistan amounted to a total of $6.4 trillion and the loss of 7,000 soldiers. This underscored the complexities and consequences of military interventions. Rather than bringing stability and democracy, these wars fueled violence and extremism, prompting reflections on the efficacy of such interventions.

### **Political Polarization and Social Tensions**
Political polarization and social tensions reached new heights during the Trump era, culminating in the Capitol attack on January 6 and challenges to U.S. democracy. The aftermath of these events raised concerns about the resilience of democratic processes and the need for unity and compromise in moving forward.

### **Trump's Foreign Policy Legacy**
Trump's foreign policy legacy sparked important discussions and analyses on issues ranging from the impact of wars to the influence of special interest groups on decision-making. As the U.S. navigates a path towards unity and healing under the Biden administration, the lessons learned from the Trump era continue to shape the future of U.S. foreign policy.

### **Conclusion**
Trump's foreign policy left deep impacts on the U.S. and the world. These impacts will play a significant role in shaping future foreign policy decisions. As the U.S. moves forward towards unity and healing under the Biden administration, the lessons from the Trump era will continue to influence the future of U.S. foreign policy.
