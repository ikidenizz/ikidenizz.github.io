  <p>Historical events must be evaluated within their own contexts, as direct comparisons between social structures of different eras can be misleading. In Islamic history, the status of dhimmi varied widely by time and region. For instance, in the Umayyad Caliphate of Spain and the Ottoman Empire, non-Muslims often held prominent roles in science, arts, and commerce, challenging the notion of rigid exclusion. Modern Islamic scholars emphasize that these historical practices are no longer applicable, highlighting Islamâ€™s core principles of justice and human dignity. In contrast, Jim Crow Laws in the United States institutionalized racial discrimination, reflecting a fundamentally different system rooted in segregation. Today, universal human rights principles advocate for equality regardless of religious or ethnic background, aligning with both Islamic teachings and modern legal frameworks. To avoid repeating past mistakes, it is essential to understand historical events within their specific contexts rather than judging them by contemporary standards. This approach fosters a deeper appreciation of history while promoting a more inclusive and just future.</p>
