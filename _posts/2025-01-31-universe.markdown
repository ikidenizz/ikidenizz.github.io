**The universe and the human brain**

The universe and the human brain continue to captivate scientists and philosophers alike as two of humanity's greatest mysteries. Questions about the state of the universe before the Big Bang, the existence of multiverses, or alternative dimensions remain unresolved enigmas. Similarly, the human brain, with its billions of neurons and trillions of connections, is often likened to a galaxy in its complexity. However, this intricate structure raises questions about the limitations of our perceptions and our experience of reality. The human eye, for instance, perceives only a small fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum—the visible light—leaving vast aspects of reality, such as ultraviolet or infrared, entirely beyond our grasp. This limited capacity to perceive and process reality prompts us to wonder whether our spiritual and emotional experiences are merely partial glimpses of a larger metaphysical reality. The Qur’an's verse, "You have been given only a little knowledge" (Surah Al-Isra, 17:85), echoes this limitation, emphasizing both the grandeur of creation and the finite scope of human understanding. Yet, these boundaries do not deter humanity; instead, they fuel our drive to explore the depths of the universe, the human brain, and spiritual dimensions, keeping alive the eternal quest to uncover the unknown and reflect on the meaning of our existence.
