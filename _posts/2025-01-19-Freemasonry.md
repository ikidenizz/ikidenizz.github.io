  <p>Freemasonry, a secretive organization with roots dating back to ancient pagan societies, has been a major force in shaping modern society, promoting materialism, humanism, and evolutionism. Its influence can be seen in various aspects of society, from politics and education to art and culture. The organization's philosophy is rooted in ancient Egyptian and Greek pagan beliefs, which have been perpetuated through secret societies such as the Knights Templar and the Rosicrucians. Freemasonry's ultimate goal is to establish a new world order based on humanism, where humanity is idolized and true religion is eradicated.</p>
