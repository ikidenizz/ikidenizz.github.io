# Peace and Justice: Achieved Through Consistency, Not Contradictions

"Prisoners are treated like queens; so why was the October 7 attack necessary? Peace and justice are achieved through consistency, not contradictions." This statement prompts us to reflect on how peace and justice can be established in a consistent manner. In this article, we will discuss this topic using verses from the Quran and other religious sources.

## Treatment of Prisoners and Justice

The Quran emphasizes the humane treatment of prisoners. Allah (SWT) says in the Quran:

> "And do good as Allah has done good to you. And desire not corruption in the land. Indeed, Allah does not like corrupters." (Al-Qasas 28:77)

This verse reminds us that treating others with kindness is essential. If prisoners are being treated like queens, it implies that all human rights should be respected equally. However, such treatment must be consistently applied and not selectively practiced only in certain situations.

## The October 7 Attack and Contradictions

The October 7 attack, however, contradicts these values. Such acts of violence undermine the principles of peace and justice. Allah (SWT) says in the Quran:

> "Whoever kills a person—it is as if he had slain mankind entirely. And whoever saves one—it is as if he had saved mankind entirely." (Al-Ma'idah 5:32)

This verse underscores the gravity of taking a life and highlights the sanctity of human life. Acts of violence like the October 7 attack severely disrupt the establishment of peace and justice within society.

## Establishing Peace and Justice

Peace and justice must be established through consistency and adherence to moral principles. Allah (SWT) says in the Quran:

> "O you who have believed, be persistently standing firm for Allah, witnesses in justice, and do not let the hatred of a people prevent you from being just. Be just; that is nearer to righteousness." (Al-Ma'idah 5:8)

This verse calls for steadfastness in justice and fairness, regardless of personal feelings or biases. Peace and justice require continuous and unwavering commitment. They cannot be achieved through sporadic efforts or contradictory actions.

In the Bible, similar messages are conveyed:

> "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God." (Matthew 5:9)

This verse from the Bible emphasizes the importance of promoting peace and being a peacemaker. Additionally, the Torah states:

> "Seek justice, correct oppression; bring justice to the fatherless, and plead the widow's cause." (Isaiah 1:17)

This verse stresses the need for justice and correcting injustices in society. The divine guidance provided by these religious texts underlines the necessity of maintaining peace and justice through consistent actions.

## Conclusion and Reflections

Peace and justice are achieved through consistency, not contradictions. If prisoners are treated like queens, then all human rights should be respected equally and consistently. The October 7 attack represents a stark contradiction to these principles, emphasizing the need for a coherent approach to establishing peace and justice.

Allah's guidance helps us understand the importance of adhering to these values continuously. Humans must interpret and apply these teachings correctly to promote peace and justice effectively.
